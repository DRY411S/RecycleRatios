# RecycleRatios
A suite of Factorio mods that allow you to specify the percentage return of recipe ingredients that can be recovered in my Recycling Machines mod.

In Factorio is not possible to change the contents of recipes whilst the world is running. It's only possible when a new world is being generated, or an existing world is loaded.

Each of the mods in this suite are 'triggers' to allow you to accumulate return percentages for the Recycling Machines to use. You can select between 10% and 100% in steps of 10% simply by enabling the relevant mods. The percentages that you choose are added together and used every time that you start a new world, or load an existing world where the Recycling Machines mod has not been used before.

# How it works

Simply download as many of the RecycleRatio0x0_0.21.3x.zip files as you wish and place them in the Factorio mods folder.

Start up Factorio and in the Mods section choose the return percentages that you wish the Recycling Machines to use.

10% = 10% mod

20% = 20% mod

30% = 10% AND 20% mods

40% = 40% mod

50% = 50% mod

60% = 10% AND 50% mods

70% = 20% AND 50% mods

80% = 10% AND 20% AND 50% mods

90% = 40% AND 50% mods

100% = NO mods

If you select mods that add up to more than 100% (for example 20% + 40% + 50%) then the percentage is capped to 100%.

The next time you generate a new world in factorio, or load a world where the Recycling Machines Mod has not been used before, the percentage return that you've selected will be used.

Note that if you change which Ratio mods to use, this will apply ONLY to new worlds, or to worlds where the Recycling Machines mod has not been used before. It won't apply to any previously save world where the Recycling Machines mod has been used.
